# Email-spam-classifier

**Overview**
This project implements a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or not spam (ham). It uses several algorithms from scikit-learn and XGBoost to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing spam emails from legitimate ones.

**Features**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial analysis of email dataset, including distribution of spam vs. ham, word frequency analysis, and data visualization.
Data Preprocessing: Includes cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization of email text data.
Model Training: Uses various machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, and XGBoost.
Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to evaluate model performance.
Deployment: Options for deployment include using Flask for a simple API or integrating with cloud services.

**Results**
Achieved an accuracy of 98% on the test dataset.
Achieved a Precision of 94% on the test dataset.
